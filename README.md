# sql-challenge

This challenge contains the analysis of csv files for employees in a company. 

All data in the csv have some kind of relationship that ultimately leads back to the employees master file. The ERD image can be found in the folder.

Some analysis was run to view different tables using inner join and where in Postgres.
